          Our Magnificent Structure

        <p>
          Behold the brilliance of SolGov, a semi-direct democratic federal
          republic that stands as a beacon of governance. Our &quot;Solar&quot;
          sectors, bathed in the light of democracy, and the
          &quot;Intersolar&quot; frontiers, where martial law prevails, together
          form a tapestry of harmony. Our citizens, blessed by the Terran
          Constitution, wield the power of referendums, shaping our government
          and challenging the tides of change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Witness the grandeur of our institutions, tirelessly working to
          maintain order and stability across all sectors, fueled by the
          boundless resources devoted to their noble cause.

          The Illustrious Department of Administrative Affairs
        </h2>
        <p>
          Within the Solar Confederation, none rival the might of the Department
          of Administrative Affairs (DAA). From its humble origins as a
          supportive office, it has burgeoned into a colossal force of 40
          billion stalwart staff members‚Äîadministrators, officials, and civil
          servants. The DAA, guardian of administrative harmony, tackles a
          myriad of tasks, from representing the Confederation to orchestrating
          colonial supply lines. It is the bedrock of stability beyond our
          beloved Sol system, the second most-encountered institution on the
          frontier.

            government.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rest assured, for the DAA pursues no selfish agenda; its sole
            concern is preserving the sacred status quo.
